I trying bundle and minify my CSS and JS files in ASP.NET Core 3.0 with BuildBundlerMinifier.Core. Also Installed Bundler & Minifier extension for Visual Studio 2019.

When I try Debug the project, it working correctly without error but when I rebuild it, I'm getting the following error;

Object reference not set to an instance of an object
